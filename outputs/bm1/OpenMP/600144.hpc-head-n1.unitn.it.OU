Start parallel solver with precomputed rows. We are using 10 processes on 7 threads.
n = 3, s = 1, M = 38, a = 1, l = 1000

Number of possible starting rows: 180
The solver found 12 solutions.
This took 1.690318 seconds on 10 processes.
The shortest running process was 0.761687 seconds long and on average a process took 1.391728 seconds (total = 13.917276).
