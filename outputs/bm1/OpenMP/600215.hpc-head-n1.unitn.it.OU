Start parallel solver with precomputed rows. We are using 20 processes on 2 threads.
n = 3, s = 1, M = 38, a = 1, l = 1000

Number of possible starting rows: 180
The solver found 12 solutions.
This took 2.623329 seconds on 20 processes.
The shortest running process was 0.565142 seconds long and on average a process took 1.871407 seconds (total = 37.428131).
