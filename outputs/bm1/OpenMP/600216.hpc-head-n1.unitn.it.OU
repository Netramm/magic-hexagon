Start parallel solver with precomputed rows. We are using 20 processes on 3 threads.
n = 3, s = 1, M = 38, a = 1, l = 1000

Number of possible starting rows: 180
The solver found 12 solutions.
This took 1.671376 seconds on 20 processes.
The shortest running process was 0.482331 seconds long and on average a process took 1.297410 seconds (total = 25.948197).
