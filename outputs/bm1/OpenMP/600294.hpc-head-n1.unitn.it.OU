Start parallel solver with precomputed rows. We are using 30 processes on 3 threads.
n = 3, s = 1, M = 38, a = 1, l = 1000

Number of possible starting rows: 180
The solver found 12 solutions.
This took 1.316985 seconds on 30 processes.
The shortest running process was 0.165648 seconds long and on average a process took 0.891634 seconds (total = 26.749028).
