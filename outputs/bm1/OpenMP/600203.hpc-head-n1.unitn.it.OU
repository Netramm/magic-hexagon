Start parallel solver with precomputed rows. We are using 10 processes on 9 threads.
n = 3, s = 1, M = 38, a = 1, l = 1000

Number of possible starting rows: 180
The solver found 12 solutions.
This took 1.178132 seconds on 10 processes.
The shortest running process was 0.509494 seconds long and on average a process took 0.985106 seconds (total = 9.851064).
